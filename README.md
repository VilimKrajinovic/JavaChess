# Java Multiplayer Chess

Project was used for college purposes. Used for pracitce of using threads, networking, Java FX, XML parsing, serialization, RMI and more. As such, chess logic was a secondary priority and remains unfinished at this point.

Some bugs are unfixed for now, looking to refactor the code sometime soon.
